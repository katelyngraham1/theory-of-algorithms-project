    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity theory is the study of how efficiently problems can be solved using algorithms. One of the key concepts in this field is the notion of a complexity class, which represents a set of problems that can be solved by a particular type of algorithm with a certain level of efficiency. The Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P) is one of the most important and well-known complexity classes in computer science, representing the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, P represents the class of problems that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time using an efficient algorithm. Efficient here means that the running time of the algorithm grows at most polynomially with the size of the input. This makes P an important class of problems for many practical applications, since polynomial time algorithms can typically handle inputs of a reasonable size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of P and related complexity classes has had a major impact on computer science and related fields, providing a theoretical foundation for algorithm design and optimization. Moreover, understanding the limitations and possibilities of different complexity classes is essential for developing secure and reliable systems in many areas, including cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook module, we will explore the theory of algorithms related to P, including examples of problems known to belong to P, techniques for verifying membership in P, and formal characterizations of the class. We will also discuss open problems and emerging areas of research related to P, and highlight the significance and implications of ongoing research in this field. Through this exploration, we hope to deepen our understanding of complexity theory and its applications, and to inspire further investigation into this fascinating and important field.

    "## Algorithms and Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. A complexity analysis of an algorithm involves determining how the running time or memory usage of the algorithm grows as the input size increases. Complexity analysis is important because it allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and to determine whether an algorithm is practical for solving large input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to measure algorithm complexity, but the most common measures are time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity is the number of basic operations, such as comparisons or additions, that an algorithm performs as a function of the input size. Space complexity is the amount of memory that an algorithm requires as a function of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity analysis allows us to classify algorithms into complexity classes, which are sets of algorithms that have similar worst-case complexity bounds. The most well-known complexity classes are P, NP, and NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed earlier, P is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. NP is the set of decision problems for which a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. NP-hard is the set of decision problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between algorithms and complexity classes is that an algorithm belongs to a complexity class if and only if its worst-case complexity bound is within the bounds of that complexity class. For example, an algorithm that can solve a decision problem in time O(n^3) belongs to P because it can solve the problem in polynomial time. An algorithm that can solve a decision problem in exponential time, such as O(2^n), does not belong to P but may belong to NP or NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, complexity analysis is a fundamental tool for comparing the efficiency of different algorithms and understanding their worst-case behavior. Complexity classes provide a framework for classifying algorithms based on their worst-case complexity bounds, and algorithms belong to complexity classes based on their worst-case complexity bounds.
